moz_psl: TLD Parsing based on the Public Suffix List
=====
**Disclaimer**:
All practical anticipations behind the development of this project have largely been scrapped in response to the reactions following Apple's iOS 14.5 privacy updates and Facebook Pixel's proclaimed support for the PSL as an authoritative means of verifying ownership. These two events have caused a surge in merge requests from marketers to the PSL repo to include suffixes that, frankly, do not provide substantive value to the public and, instead, represent the hustle of self-interested advertisers to game corporate policies at the expense of undermining what was supposed to be community-ran project to curate trusted means of effective domain authorship.
